# The first number gives us the test statistic i.e. 1.194 and the second number gives us the p-value, which is .2. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis and infer that the new changes didnot have any significant difference in conversion rate

# A z-statistic, or z-score, is a number representing the valueâ€™s relationship to the mean of a group of values, it is measured with population parameters such as population standard deviation and used to validate a hypothesis.
