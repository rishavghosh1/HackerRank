# We see that the mean conversion rate for the treatment group is actually less than the control group, however, the difference is very less. We have 12% conversion rate for control vs 11.9% conversion rate for Treatment. We can see that there is very little difference, however we need to check if this difference is statistically significant

# The null hypothesis is that the difference between the 2 means is not statistically significant. p-value has to be greater than 0.05 to prove this.
# We chose 2 sample z test here as z-test is the statistical test, used to analyze whether two population means are different or not when the variances are known and the sample size is large.

ztest1=ztest(cdf,tdf,value=0)
ztest1


# The first number gives us the test statistic i.e. 1.194 and the second number gives us the p-value, which is .2. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis and infer that the new changes didnot have any significant difference in conversion rate

# A z-statistic, or z-score, is a number representing the valueâ€™s relationship to the mean of a group of values, it is measured with population parameters such as population standard deviation and used to validate a hypothesis.
